These are jupyter notebooks on topics in computational finance. 
* The "Aproximating_Greeks" notebook demonstrates how to use partial derivative methods to approximate different greeks.
* The "Pricing_Options_with_MonteCarlo" notebook demonstrates how Monte Carlo simulation can be used to simulate asset prices then estimate option prices.
